# Kozykoding – Full Stack Portfolio

Welcome to my full stack portfolio project. This repo powers my personal site, where I showcase selected projects, experiments, and the technologies I enjoy working with.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Go (Golang)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Features**: REST APIs, modern tooling, component-driven UI

## What This Project Demonstrates

- **Production-style architecture**: Separation between React frontend, Go backend, and Postgres database.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Accessible, responsive layout using ShadCN UI and Tailwind for rapid styling.
- **API design**: Typed request/response flows between frontend and backend.
- **Data modeling**: Postgres database to support typical CRUD features.
